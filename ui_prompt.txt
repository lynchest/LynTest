"Design a simple, modern, and sleek SaaS-style dark theme user interface for a keyboard typing speed test website. The layout should be clean and intuitive, prioritizing the typing experience.

**Key Elements to Include:**
1.  **Main Typing Area:** A prominent, central section for displaying the text to be typed. The text should be highly readable, with clear visual feedback for correct and incorrect characters (e.g., green for correct, red for incorrect, or subtle highlighting).
2.  **Input Field:** A clean, minimalist input area directly below the typing text, where the user types. It should have a subtle focus state.
3.  **Real-time Metrics Display:** A compact, easily visible area (e.g., at the top or side) showing:
    *   **Timer:** Counting down or up.
    *   **WPM (Words Per Minute):** Live update.
    *   **Accuracy:** Live update (percentage).
4.  **Control Buttons:** Simple, clear buttons for "Start Test," "Restart," and potentially "Change Text." These should be easily accessible but not distracting.
5.  **Results Summary:** After a test, a clear, concise display of the final WPM, accuracy, and duration.
6.  **Past Results/History:** A small, scrollable section (e.g., on the side or bottom) to list previous test scores (WPM, accuracy, date), retrieved from localStorage. This should be subtle and not overpower the main test area.

**Visual Style:**
*   **Theme:** Dark mode, professional, and modern SaaS aesthetic.
*   **Color Palette:** Dominant dark grays/blacks for background, with subtle, professional accent colors (e.g., a muted blue, teal, or purple) for highlights, buttons, and metrics. Text should be light (white/light gray) for high contrast.
*   **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto, Open Sans) for readability. Use varying font weights and sizes to establish hierarchy.
*   **Spacing & Layout:** Ample whitespace, well-defined sections, and a responsive design that looks good on desktop.
*   **Icons (Optional):** Minimalistic icons for controls or metrics if appropriate.
*   **Overall Feel:** Efficient, focused, non-distracting, and visually appealing for extended use.

**Avoid:** Overly complex animations, skeuomorphism, or bright, distracting colors. Focus on functionality and a smooth user experience within a dark, modern theme."
